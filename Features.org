   + Grass spread is slower
   + Polar bears have Haste 3
   + Lava spreads faster, and even faster in the Nether

   + Shearing a sheep creates an explosion that only damages the
     player and knocks them back

     food item

     player

   + Vex will occasionally transform into strays
   + Turtle shell and chainmail are the only craftable helmets
   + Chainmail armor is craftable from buckets of lava
   + When the player takes damage, they might drop redstone
     - Excludes damage from fire, lava, poison, and wither

   + Redstone torches drop redstone

   + The world starts with an 80x80 world border. At noon, the world
     extends by 16 in all directions
   + Bedrock change
     - **bedrock** only applies to leaves and glass
     - All blocks have a chance to transform into leaves when mined
     - Blocks which **bedrock** formerly applied to have a higher
       chance of transforming into leaves
     - Bedrock can now be mined... veeeeery slowly
     - When bedrock is mined, the player is teleported 72 blocks down
       (Tempting the Void)

   + Stardew Slime Loot - Slimes have an increased loot pool. They may
     drop the following (see chat)
   + Minecraft Trivia: Every 30 mins a random trivia question is asked
     in chat. Any player who answers correctly gets an appropriate
     item. Any player who fails to answer is struck by lightning.
     Players who answer wrongly are not rewarded or punished.
   + Moss Revenge: When a moss block is broken, small chance of small
     slime to spawn
   + Mundane potions can be crafted into gold nuggets
   + Gold nuggets can be eaten for nutrition. They act like sweet
     berries

       small chance of breaking

     slowness, nausea, or blindness for a short time
   + When a player harvests beetroot, small chance a rabbit will spawn
